## 1. What went well
- I was able to understand and apply **React components and state** in our previous practical exam.  
-  I learned that React uses JSX, which is stricter than HTML. I also learned the history of React, its versioning, and the different exporting methods. In addition, I gained an understanding of how state works behind the scenes and how **React’s Reconciliation** process compares the previous and new Virtual DOM to determine and apply updates efficiently.
- I learned basic commands how to create react project in one line, what is the best practices when pushing codes (Micro or Macro) and more.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- I struggled with the final practical exam. Every time I changed something, an error occurred, and I was unable to understand why I couldn’t properly apply the template.
- I personally contributed to some delays and confusion in the team when there were sudden changes in client requirements, which required adjustments to our plans.
- During the group work, our team initially had different approaches and perspectives, which led to some challenges in aligning our tasks and responsibilities. These differences caused slight delays at the beginning

## 3. Key Learnings
- Learned how state management works and how React’s reconciliation process efficiently updates the UI.
- Gained an understanding of React fundamentals, including components, props, state, JSX, and the Virtual DOM.
- Improved team collaboration, including adapting to different approaches, handling requirement changes, and communicating updates effectively. 
- Gained experience in managing client requirement changes and understanding their impact on development timelines.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- Improve understanding of JavaScript in JSX, including curly braces, **conditional rendering**, and event handling.  
- Enhance knowledge of Git and GitHub workflows, including **resets, rebasing, merging**, and resolving conflicts.
